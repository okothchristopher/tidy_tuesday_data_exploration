## STORIES FROM THE DATA 
------
[Week 20](https://github.com/okothchristopher/tidy_tuesday_data_exploration/blob/master/2020_week_20_volcano_erruptions)

This week was on exploring the different volcanoes recorded around the world. 

The following are types of volcanoes :
>1. **Composite Volcanoes**
Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. The eruptions from these volcanoes may be a pyroclastic flow rather than a flow of lava. A pyroclastic flow is a superheated mixture of hot steam, ash, rock and dust. A pyroclastic flow can travel down the side of a volcano at very high speeds with temperatures over 400 degrees celsius. Composite volcanoes can rise over 8000 feet.
When composite volcanoes erupt they are explosive and pose a threat to nearby life and property. Eruptions are explosive due to the thick, highly viscous lava that is produced by composite cone volcanoes. This viscous lava has a lot to do with why they are shaped the way they are. The thick lava cannot travel far down the slope of the volcano before it cools.
Composite volcanoes are usually found at destructive plate margins. Examples of composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji (Japan), Mount St Helens (USA) and Mount Pinatubo (Philippines).


>2. **Shield Volcanoes**
Shield volcanoes are low with gently sloping sides and are formed from layers of lava. Eruptions are typically non-explosive. Shield volcanoes produce fast flowing fluid [lava] that can flow for many miles. Eruptions tend to be frequent but relatively gentle. Although these eruptions destroy property, death or injury to humans rarely occurs.
Shield volcanoes are usually found at constructive boundaries and sometimes at volcanic hotspots. Examples of shield volcanoes include Mount Kilauea and Maunaloa on Hawaii.

>3. **Dome (Acid Lava Cones)**
Acid [lava] is much thicker than [lava] which flows from shield volcanoes. Dome volcanoes have much steeper sides than shield volcanoes. This is because the lava is thick and sticky. It cannot flow very far before it cools and hardens. An example is Puy de Dome in the Auvergne region of France which last erupted over 1 million years ago.

### Which volcanoes have the most devastating effects to life?
![Volcano_Primary_Types](https://github.com/okothchristopher/tidy_tuesday_data_exploration/blob/master/2020_week_20_volcano_erruptions/volcano_by_elavation.png)
The above data supports the theory that Stratovolcanoes are the highest reaching in terms of elevation and that shield volcanoes have far traveling lava thus affect a major portion of the population compared to the latter. 

Tuff cones are also types of Maars. Calderas are also found at the summit of Shield volcanoes implying that they are of the same category. This goes on to confirm the fact the shield volcanoes are among the most devastating types of volcanoes to life around since they are shallow and large in area of coverage. 

### Distribution of the volcano types on the globe

[week 36 ](https://github.com/okothchristopher/tidy_tuesday_data_exploration/tree/master/2020_week_36_crop_yields)

## crop production efficiency - comparison between the USA, Kenya and China 
#### In which crops do these countries excel in ?
![](https://github.com/okothchristopher/tidy_tuesday_data_exploration/blob/master/2020_week_36_crop_yields/crop_production_efficiency.png)

> The findings from the data exploration


Kenya - The yields of crops in tonnes per hectare have been steadily rising since the 1960's . This can be attributed to the extensive use of modern agricultural methods and use of pesticides. 
The crops maize, soybeans and bananas have a relatively lower yield in tones per hectare compared to their counterparts.

Beans saw its peak yield per hectare in the 1980's but fell drastically in years heading to 2000. It has seen a steady rise ever since but has not rebounded to its former glory. 

The crop production efficiency in Kenya however, compared to other major countries like the US and China, is more turbulent, ie there are regular fluctuations in the yields per hectare of the crops under study. 

The USA does not produce cassava while China does't have peas. The USA has a higher maize,potato,soybeans, peas and beans production efficiency compare to the other two nations. This is indicative of better crop production methods and mechanization.
